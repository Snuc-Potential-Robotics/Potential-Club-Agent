# 🔧 Dependency Conflict Fix

## Problem Encountered

After fixing the Rust compilation issue, a **new dependency conflict** appeared:

```
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 13) and google-generativeai==0.3.2 
because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested google-generativeai==0.3.2
    langchain-google-genai 0.0.11 depends on google-generativeai>=0.4.1
```

## Root Cause

- `langchain-google-genai==0.0.11` requires `google-generativeai>=0.4.1`
- We had specified `google-generativeai==0.3.2` (outdated version)
- These two requirements conflicted

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changed in `requirements.txt`:

```diff
# LangChain & AI
langchain==0.1.20
langchain-core==0.1.52
langchain-google-genai==0.0.11
langgraph==0.0.20
- google-generativeai==0.3.2
+ google-generativeai==0.4.1
```

### Why This Works:

- `google-generativeai==0.4.1` satisfies the requirement of `>=0.4.1`
- Version 0.4.1 still has pre-built wheels for Python 3.11 ✅
- No breaking changes between 0.3.2 and 0.4.1 for basic usage
- All packages remain compatible

## ✅ Validation

Confirmed all packages:
- ✅ Have pre-built wheels (no Rust compilation)
- ✅ Compatible with Python 3.11
- ✅ No dependency conflicts
- ✅ Stable versions

## 📦 Final Package Versions

```
fastapi==0.109.0
