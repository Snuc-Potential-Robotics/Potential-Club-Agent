# 🎯 Event Handling System - Complete Fix

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

This update completely fixes the event handling system with proper date/time awareness and comprehensive validation.

---

## 🔧 Problems Fixed

### 1. ✅ "Show upcoming events" now works correctly
- **Before**: Showed ALL events including completed ones
- **After**: Shows ONLY upcoming and today's events
- **Validation**: Event dates are compared against current date/time

### 2. ✅ Registration validation is now enforced
- **Before**: Users could register for any event, even completed ones
- **After**: Users can ONLY register for upcoming or today's events
- **Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid attempts

### 3. ✅ Feedback validation is now enforced
- **Before**: Users could give feedback for any event
- **After**: Users can ONLY give feedback for today's events or recently completed ones (<7 days)
- **Validation**: Clear error messages explaining timing rules

### 4. ✅ Search now finds relevant events
- **Before**: Limited search, often missed relevant events
- **After**: Searches across name, description, and category with keyword matching
- **Validation**: Results sorted by relevance

## 📊 Event Classification System

Events are now intelligently classified:

| Status | Description | Can Register? | Can Give Feedback? |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **UPCOMING** | Future events | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **ONGOING** | Happening today (future time) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **COMPLETED (Today)** | Earlier today | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **COMPLETED (<7 days)** | Recent past | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **COMPLETED (>7 days)** | Old past | ❌ No | ❌ No |

---

## 🎯 Query Examples

### ✅ Upcoming Events
```
User: "Show upcoming events"
System: Lists ONLY future and today's events with timing info
```

### ✅ Today's Events
```
User: "What events are happening today?"
System: Lists ONLY events scheduled for today
```

### ✅ Search by Name
```
User: "Tell me about robotics workshop"
System: Searches name, description, category for matches
```

### ✅ Registration Validation
```
User: "I want to register for last week's event"
System: "Cannot register for completed events. This event took place 7 days ago."
```

### ✅ Feedback Validation
```
User: "Give feedback for next week's workshop"
System: "Cannot submit feedback for upcoming events. Please wait until the event happens."
```

## 📖 Key Improvements

### 1. Date/Time Awareness
- ✅ Accurate date comparison (normalized to start of day)
- ✅ Handles timezone-aware and naive datetime
- ✅ Considers both date and time for "today" classification

### 2. Smart Filtering
- ✅ Type-based filtering: `upcoming`, `today`, `completed`, `all`
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ Keyword search across multiple fields

### 3. Comprehensive Validation
- ✅ Event existence checks
- ✅ Timing validation for registration
- ✅ Timing validation for feedback
- ✅ Slot availability checks
- ✅ Clear, user-friendly error messages

### 4. Enhanced Search
- ✅ Multi-field search (name, description, category)
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Partial word matching
- ✅ Multi-word query support
- ✅ Relevance-based sorting

---

## 🔍 Validation Results

### Classification Logic Test: ✅ PASSED
```
✅ Past events correctly identified as COMPLETED
✅ Today's events correctly identified as ONGOING
✅ Future events correctly identified as UPCOMING
✅ Registration permissions correct for all cases
✅ Feedback permissions correct for all cases
✅ Time descriptions accurate ("in 5 days", "today", "3 days ago")
```

### Edge Cases Handled: ✅ PASSED
```
✅ Empty database scenario
✅ No matching events scenario
✅ Invalid date formats
✅ Registration for full events
✅ Registration for completed events
✅ Feedback for upcoming events
✅ Feedback for old completed events
```

✅ **Professional UX**
- Timing context in responses ("in 5 days", "today", "3 days ago")
- Action availability clearly indicated
- Helpful suggestions and error messages

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If tests fail:
1. Ensure Python environment is set up correctly
2. Check that all dependencies are installed
3. Verify database connection (if using full agent tests)
4. Review error logs for specific issues

### If agent responses are wrong:
1. Check current date/time handling in `classify_event()`
2. Verify tool parameter formats in agent prompt
3. Review tool selection logic in system prompt
4. Check database date format consistency
