# Event Handling System - Fixes and Improvements

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Problem: "Show upcoming events" was showing completed events**

**Root Cause**: 
- The system wasn't properly filtering events by date
- Events were classified as "upcoming" even if they had already happened

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created `classify_event()` function that accurately determines event status based on current date/time
- ✅ Added proper date comparison logic (comparing dates normalized to start of day)
- ✅ Implemented three clear event statuses: `completed`, `ongoing`, `upcoming`
- ✅ Modified `get_upcoming_events` tool to accept type parameter: `upcoming`, `today`, `completed`, `all`

**Result**: 
```
Query: "Show upcoming events"
NOW SHOWS: Only future events and today's events
DOES NOT SHOW: Past/completed events
```

---

### 2. ❌ **Problem: Users could register for completed events**

**Root Cause**:
- No validation of event timing before registration
- Registration tool accepted any event regardless of date

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive validation in `register_for_event` tool
- ✅ Checks event date and classification before allowing registration
- ✅ Only allows registration for `upcoming` or `ongoing` (today's) events
- ✅ Provides clear error messages when registration is not allowed

**Result**:
```
Query: "Register for event from last week"
Response: "Cannot register for completed events. This event took place 7 days ago."
```

---

### 3. ❌ **Problem: Users could give feedback for upcoming events**

**Root Cause**:
- No validation of whether event had occurred before accepting feedback
- Allowed feedback submission for any event

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added strict validation in `submit_feedback` tool
- ✅ Only allows feedback for:
  - Events happening today (ongoing)
  - Recently completed events (within last 7 days)
- ✅ Blocks feedback for upcoming events
- ✅ Blocks feedback for events completed > 7 days ago

**Result**:
```
Query: "Give feedback for next week's workshop"
Response: "Cannot submit feedback for upcoming events. This event is scheduled in 7 days. 
Please wait until the event happens."
```

---

### 4. ❌ **Problem: Search returning irrelevant events (e.g., "robot event" returning "abc" event)**

**Root Cause**:
- Limited search functionality only checked event names
- No keyword or description-based searching

**Solution**:
- ✅ Enhanced `search_events_by_name` to search across:
  - Event name
  - Event description
  - Event category
- ✅ Added multi-word query support
- ✅ Implemented relevance-based sorting (ongoing → upcoming → completed)
- ✅ Case-insensitive and partial matching

**Result**:
```
Query: "Tell me about robotics events"
NOW RETURNS: All events with "robotics" in name, description, or category
SORTED BY: Relevance and date
```

---

## New Features Added

### 1. **Event Classification System**

Every event now includes rich classification data:

```json
{
  "event_status": "upcoming|ongoing|completed",
  "is_today": true/false,
  "time_description": "in 5 days" | "today" | "3 days ago",
  "can_register": true/false,
  "can_give_feedback": true/false
}
```

### 2. **Smart Event Type Filtering**

New query types supported:

| Query | Parameter | Shows |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| "Show upcoming events" | `{"type": "upcoming"}` | Future + Today |
| "What's today?" | `{"type": "today"}` | Only today's events |
| "Show all events" | `{"type": "all"}` | All events |
| "Past events" | `{"type": "completed"}` | Only past events |

### 3. **Enhanced Search Capabilities**

- Multi-field search (name, description, category)
- Keyword-based matching
- Relevance sorting
- Context-aware results

### 4. **Comprehensive Validation**

All actions now validated:
- ✅ Event existence
- ✅ Event timing (upcoming/today/completed)
- ✅ Slot availability (for registration)
- ✅ Date-based eligibility
- ✅ Clear error messages

---

## Updated Agent Behavior

### Improved System Prompt

The agent now has:
- Clear date/time awareness
- Intelligent tool selection rules
- Context-aware response formatting
- Explicit validation logic for all actions

### Example Interactions

#### Before (Problematic):
```
User: "Show upcoming events"
Agent: Lists ALL events including past ones ❌
```

#### After (Fixed):
```
User: "Show upcoming events"
Agent: Lists ONLY future and today's events ✅
      Includes timing info (e.g., "in 5 days")
      Shows what actions are available
```
