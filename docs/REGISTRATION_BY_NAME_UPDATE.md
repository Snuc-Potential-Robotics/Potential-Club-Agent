# üéØ Registration & Feedback by Event Name - Update

## Overview

The system has been enhanced to allow users to register and give feedback using **event names** instead of requiring exact UUIDs. The agent now also intelligently collects all user details in a single prompt if provided.

## ‚úÖ What's New

### 1. **Registration by Event Name** ‚≠ê PRIMARY FEATURE

Users can now register using the event name directly:

```

```
User: "Register me for abc workshop. Name: John Doe, Email: john@nit.ac.in, 
       Phone: 9876543210, Class: IoT, Section: A, Year: 2024"
       
Agent: ‚úÖ Successfully registered John Doe for abc workshop!
```

### 2. **Feedback by Event Name** ‚≠ê PRIMARY FEATURE

Users can now give feedback using the event name:

```
User: "Feedback for abc event: john@nit.ac.in, 5 stars, excellent workshop!"
Agent: ‚úÖ Thank you for your feedback on abc! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

### 3. **Smart Information Collection**

The agent now:
- ‚úÖ Extracts ALL information if provided in one message
